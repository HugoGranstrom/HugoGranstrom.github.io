Hello World!

This is my first blog post here. I'm a science student in Sweden who is interested in mathematics and programming. 
My programming language of choice is Python, mainly because I think Java (my first language) and the others look too cluttered with their overuse of curly brackets {}.  

Here is the line of code most of us had as our first computer program:
{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
Ahh... What nostalgia! My memories come back from when I was 13 and coded Java on my 4 inch android phone with "Hacker's Keyboard".
