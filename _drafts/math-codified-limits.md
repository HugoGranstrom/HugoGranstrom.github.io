title: Math Codified - Limits

Limits are a concept in math used in various situations, for example when calculating derivatives. I have a article about how to understand derivatives using python [here].

Limits are used when a function $$f(x)$$ isn't defined for a certain input $$x$$ or if we want to see if the function has a limit at $$+\infty$$ or $$-\infty$$ ie if the function converges at infinity (functions can also converge to other functions which I will show an example of at the end of this article). That a function converges means that there is a number that the function approaches at $$\infty$$, an invisible line it never crosses. Often it can be seen as a "ceiling" or a "floor" like in this picture.

A limit is written as this: 

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$$

$$\lim$$ stands for *limes* in latin but I always think of it as standing for the english word *limit*, so if you hear someone talk about *limes* they are probably talking about limits.
